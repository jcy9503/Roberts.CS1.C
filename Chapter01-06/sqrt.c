 * Function: Sqrt
 * Usage: root = Sqrt(x);
 * ----------------------
 * Returns the square root of x, calculated using a
 * Taylor series expansion, as described in the text.
 * The Sqrt function is actually implemented as two
 * functions. The job of the outer Sqrt function is to
 * divide the argument repeatedly by 4 until it is in
 * the range 0 < x < 2, where the Taylor series converges.
 * It then calls TSqrt to perform the actual Taylor series
 * calculation. When finished, Sqrt adjusts the answer by
 * multiplying the result by 2 for each time it needed to
 * be divided by 4 to bring it in range.
